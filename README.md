## Overview

**Project Title**: Online Chat

**Project Description**: Someone would be able to host a server and then someone esle would be able to connect to that server and they could communicate back and forth.

**Project Goals**: I want to split the project into smaller chunks and make sure I spend a lot of time reasearching and understanding the topic before I jump straight into it. I hope by the end I have a functional product and that I have a basic understandig of networking.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download the program on 2 devices or on one device with a VM
2. Run the program on both devices, one as the server and one as the client

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the Softwear as the server and input an IP addres and a Port
2. Run the Softwear as the client and put in the servers IP and port
3. Make sure it says that it was connected on both ends.
4. Send a message on the client side and see it on the servers end
5. Send a message on the servers side and see it on the client's end
6. type EXIT on the client's terminal to dissconect from the server
7. Once the client is disconected another client can connect to the server

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Python
*VM or second device
* Socket and Threading Libraries in Python

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Python Networking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-network-programming/)
*[Promming a Netowrk in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jteAOmdsYg&list=PLhTjy8cBISErYuLZUvVOYsR1giva2payF)
*[Socket Library]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jteAOmdsYg&list=PLhTjy8cBISErYuLZUvVOYsR1giva2payF](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html))

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I want to make the sectioning and pringing of statments more seperated so it is easier to see what you typed vs what you recived from the other person
* [ ] Allow for encryption of messages
* [ ] Be able to send flies more more complex items over the network.
